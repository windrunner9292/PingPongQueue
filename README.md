2. In the Dashboard, the user can monitor the queue status and rankings (for SGF only) for different offices and put him/herself into the queue against different users.
3. On the Profile page, the user can see the game history and winrate, update the username and email, and join/leave the league.
4. on the Hall of Fame page, the past tournament winners are listed.

   - Add new use</li>
   - Delete the existing user
